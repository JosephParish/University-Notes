#### OVERVIEW:
- Main goal of DB design is to decide which tables to create.
- 2 Principles:
	- Capture all info needed to be captured
		- Enforced with an ER Diagram
	- Have the above with little redundancy
		- Enforced with Normalisation

#### ER DIAGRAMS:
A visual representation of the information which can be captured by a database.
This can do 3 things:
- Allows DB pros to describe an overall design consisely and accurately
- Most of it can be transformed into the relational schema
- It may help identifying some problems in a design
