When considering an algorithm, we consider: 
- Worst Case
	- 0.5(n^2) assuming you must move all to the other side
- Best Case
	-  Linear O(n)  assuming all items are in the right place. 
		- n is the size of the array
- Average case
	- Half of the worst case. 0.25(n^2)

#### Algorithm Analysis:
- Runtime
- Memory
- Number of basic operations
	- Arithmetic Operations (Matrix Multiplication)
	- Bit Operations (Multiplying Integers)
	- Comparisons (Sorting and Searching)

- Input size is the main parameter
	- Then it's if it's the best, worst or average case.

#### Exact Analysis: Rarely achieved, very complex
