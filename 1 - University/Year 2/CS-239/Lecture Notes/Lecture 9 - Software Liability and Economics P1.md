#### Main Questions: 
- what legal responsibility could be posed by software security issues?
	- By software developers and operators of system with embedded software
	- How do we understand software security in terms of economic costs and benefits?
		- How could we use this to improve security?

#### Liability arising out of software development and use
- Legal responsibility may arise out of harm and damage due to software design or development for a range of reasons including:
	- Harm to an individual due to a loss of privacy
	- Damage to an organisation due to disruption or loss due to software design.
		- due to poor design, incorrect design or implementation or errors
	- Loss of life due to similar software problems in safety-critical systems
	- Reputational damage arising out of networked software where deliberate software design leads to bias
		- Similar impact due to AI? 

#### The first bug was a real bug :o 

#### Misaligned incentives and liabilities for cybersecurity
- Liability should be assigned to the party involved that is best placed to manage the cybersecurity risk
- Is this always the case?
	- Customers are often liable for the cost of fraud as a result of online identity theft and not their banks
	- Users fo not spend much on protecting their home PCs as they dont stand to lose much as a result of compromise and their machine being used to launch a DOS attack on a website

- Cost to consumers (users)
	- Cost due to damage, loss of productivity and loss of product / service
	- Operational costs of patch management
- Benefits to vendors (software industry and developers)
	- benefits of early product releases
	- benefits of lower product testing cost
- Cost to vendors
	- cost of patch development and release
	- cost of customer reporting and support
	- loss of reputation (less future business)
	- legal liability

#### Framing the problem of cybersecurity
" Computer security isnt a technological problem, its an economic problem"
Software security needs to be in a company's economic best interest
Fewer vulnerabilities when the entities that have the capability to reduce vulnerabilities have the economic incentive to do so.

#### Final Thoughts:
- Tangible manifestation of software leads to legal and regulatory implications
- Economic cost and benefit arising out of the process and implications of software lead to dynamics that can be influenced for more effective security
