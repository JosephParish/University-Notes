#### Risk Assessment and Treatment:
- Risk Assessment
	- Impact Types:
		- Safety
		- Financial
		- Operational
		- Privacy
	- Impact Ratings:
		- Severe
		- Major
		- Moderate
		- Negligible
- Risk Treatment:
	- Avoid
		- Redesign or remove a component or feature
	- Reduce
		- Through security controls and mechanisms placed to reduce likelihood or impact
	- Transfer or Share
		- to another component or entity
	- Accept
		- the risk (L, potentially monitor it)

#### Nature Of Risk:
- A typology of cyber risks which describes both risk as potential threads and as uncertainty.
- Risk as potential threats
	- Considers threats that are definable, identifiable, immediate and often connected to specific threatening actors
- Risk as Uncertainty
	- Treats risks as systemic and inherent, an emphasis on socio-technical vulnerability leading to a greater extent and acceptance of the unknown

- Cybersecurity risks may also evolve to a number of possibilities including:
	- Not seen so far
	- Dramatically altering mitigation costs
	- Unexpected stakeholder liabilities
	- Change of ownership of risk
- Another factor to consider is residual risk, which is risk remaining once mitigation is deployed for inherent risks

#### Interplay between safety and security:
- An example of a security critical system that is not safety-critical is an in-vehicle entertainment system.
	- Obtains personal information from the driver
		- Could lead to privacy or financial losses 
		- However will not lead to safety issues

- An example of a system that is both security and safety critical would be an automatic braking system.
	- It is safety critical as if it does not work properly it could lead to harm of vehicle occupants
	- It is also security critical as if it is attacked, it could lead to harm of vehicle occupants
