#### Vulnerability Management: Disclosure
- Full disclosure may lead to malicious attacks and cost to consumers, but provides incentive for manufacturers to release patch
- Non-disclosure makes informing customers difficult, which may cause more damage is consumers are not prepared
- Partial disclosure to an ageed set of stakeholders and manufacturers who could put in measures to minimise damage before public disclosure and announcement
- Ethical / Legal / Regulatory considerations?
