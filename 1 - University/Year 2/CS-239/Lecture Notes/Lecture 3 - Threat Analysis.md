#### PRE-LECTURE NOTES:
- The reading helps a lot with getting the higher marks in grades and coursework as it offers wider information

#### A THREAT IS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY NOTION:
- Threat actors are also commonly limited by time 

#### KEY ATTRIBUTES TO CHARACTERISE THREATS:
- Elapsed time
	- Time taken to identify and exploit a vulnerability
	- The longer it takes, the more likely a threat may be nullified

- Specialist Knowledge Required
	- Correspond to specialist technical expertise required
	- Layman / Proficient / Expert / Multiple Experts

- Knowledge of the target
	- Representing design and operational knowledge
	- Public / Restricted / Confidential / Strictly Confidential

- Window of opportunity
	- Denote the level of access and time window of opportunity available to realise the threat
	- Unlimited / Easy / Moderate / Difficult

- Equipment and Resources Needed
	- Refers to hardware, software or other equipment required for exploitation
	- Standard / Specialised / Bespoke / Multiple Bespoke

#### Other Attributes To Consider:
- Stealth
	- purposefully designed / delivered threats avoiding detection
- Attribution
	- Process of identifying the source of the threat
- Commodity Malware VS Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

#### ATTRIBUTION: THE ISSUE:
- The most challenging set of attacks to investigate and deter are multi stage attacks where computer A penetrates computer B which is used to penetrate computer C which attacks computer D.
- Better attribution techniques dont solve or prevent these
- Redesigning the network to accomplish robust attribution would not solve the most serious network-based cyber attacks and exploitations being experienced today which are multi stage and multi jurisdictional.
