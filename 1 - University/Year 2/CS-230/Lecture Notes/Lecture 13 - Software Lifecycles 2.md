#### AGILE METHODS:
- Agile methods are the cool, new alternative to waterfall which fixes the inflexibility
- This lets code be adjusted incase user requirements are misinterpreted (commonly happens)

#### RAPID DEVELOPMENT:
- Rapid development and delivery is often the most wanted requirement now
- Software needs to evolve quickly to reflect changing business needs

#### AGILE METHODS:
- Focus on the code rather than the design
- Are based on an iterative approach to software development
- Are intended to deliver working software quickly and evolve for changing requirements
- They reduce overheads so less documentation, and much more iterative

#### TENETS OF AGILE:
- Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

#### WHEN TO USE AGILE:
- Small or medium project
- Clear commitment from the customer to be involved and not a lot of external rules or regulations

#### PROBLEMS WITH AGILE:
- Can be hard to keep customers interested in development process
- Team members may be unused to the intense development around these models
- Prioritising changes can be hard with many stakeholders

#### INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
- Develop the system in increments and evaluate each increment before proceeding to the development of the next increment
- Then do a waterfall style model for the next incremenent

#### INCREMENTAL DELIVERY
- Deploy an increment for use by end-users
- More realistic evaluation and practical use of the software
-  Deployment of an increment can influence spec of future increments
