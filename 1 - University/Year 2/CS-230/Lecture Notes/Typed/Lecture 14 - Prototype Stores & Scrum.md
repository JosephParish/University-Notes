- Many software lifecycle models revolve around / need prototypes
- Sometimes the requirements may not be clear, and prototypes can help users figure out what they want and helps us meet on an acceptable solution

#### PROTOTYPES: 
- An initial, early version of a system used to demonstrate concepts  and try out design options.
- Can be used in:
	- Requirements engineering, to help the stakeholder figure out what they actually want
	- Design process, to explore particular solutions and develop UI designs.
		- E.G: Paper based mockups
		- Versions of software which implement a feature in a rough way
- A concrete, but partial system implementation
- Quick to generate, easy to throw away

#### PAPER PROTOTYPES:
- Low fidelity prototype involving screens sketched on paper
- Designer moves paper around to indicate interaction
