#### WATERFALL MODEL
- Put stages in sequence, one following the next
- Documents and deliverables indicate the transition between stages

#### WATERFALL MODEL STEP 1: SPECIFICATION
- Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:
	- What do the stakeholders require / expect from the system
- Requirements Specification
	- Description of functions, data, and documentation
	- Performance and environmental aspects
- Feasibility Study
	- Financial and technically diasible
- Requirements Validations
	- Check we have the right requirements

#### WATERFALL MODEL STEP 2: DESIGN
- Early design decisions are take: 
	- Focuses on what needs to be done, and not how
	- The design describes how the approach should look

#### WATERFALL MODEL STEP 3: IMPLEMENTATION
- Focus on individual components
- The output should be robust, working and flexible
- The modern module / class concept can be useful

#### WATERFALL MODEL STEP 4: TESTING
- Does the software do what it's supposed to do?
- Are we buildin the right system? (Validation)
- Are we building the system properly? (Verification)
- Early testing is a bonus

#### WATERFALL MODEL STEP 5: MAINTENANCE
- Aim to correct any errors after the delivery of the software
	- adapt to changing requirements and environment
	- The most time consuming part

#### WATERFALL MODEL: PROS AND CONS: 
PROS:
- Plan driven, separate identified phases
- Everything fully analysed and specified
- Produces a lot of documentation
CONS: 
- Very inflexible
	- not good as modern code is done over many sites

#### TYPES OF MAINTENANCE:
- Corrective Maintenance - Correcting errors
- Adaptive Maintenance - Adapting to changes in the environment (hardware and software)
- Perfective maintenance - Adapting to changing user requirements
- Preventative maintenance - Increasing software maintainability / reliability to prevent future problems
