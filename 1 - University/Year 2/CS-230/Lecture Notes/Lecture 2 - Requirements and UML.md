- Large Programs are difficult to coordinate and write


#### Requirements Analysis:
##### User Requirements:
- Natural Language
- "The system should do X" - Relating to the functionality of the system
##### System Requirements: 
- Natural language.
- Functions, services and operational constraints
- Quantifiable, for the most part
^ These usually are contained within legal contracts

#### Good Requirements: 
- Valid (What they really want)
- Consistent (No conflicts / Contradictions)
- Complete (Nothing Missing, within reason ofc)
- Realistic (Can be implemented)

#### Requirement Documents: 
- User requirements + System Requirements
- Detailed as Possible
- Not a design doc
	- Focuses on "what" as opposed to the "how" which a design doc covers
	- Doesn't focus on the particular approach

#### Functional VS Non-Functional Requirements:
- Functional:
	- What it should do
	- How it reacts to given scenarios, specification and data
- Non Functional
	- Global Statements. Not related to specific user services
	- "Secure" , "X - Compliant"
	- Not always clear-cut

#### Often, requirements use another field's language:
- E.G. Aerospace, Business, Social Sciences
- Look for a common language to prevent misundersanding
	- Clear, natural language
	- Diagrams, tables and formulae
- Can use: 
	- Pictures (Informal)
	- Propositional Logic (Formal)
		- With a natural language description
	- Formal Specification Language (Like CaSL)
	- Process Algebra (CCS, CSP)

#### Bad Spec + Requirements? Bad Design.
- If the spec doesn't explicitly call for something, it likely won't be done

#### Feasability Studies:
- Check if the system is useful
- Check if it's delivered on budget

#### Requirements Elicitation & Analysis:
- Business analysts work with stakeholders to find their needs
- Produces prototypes and stories and checks "is it ok"

#### Requirements Validation
- Check Requirements
	- Error Free, Consistent and complete

#### Requirements Management


#### UML: Unified Modelling Language
- Offers you a choice of diagram (Many diagrams to use) 
- Different Levels of Abstraction
	- High Overview Level
	- Low Detailed Level
- Connected to reality
	- Make sure all your models are related to reality.
		- Ensure each model does one thing. 2 things? 2 models.

2 Categories of diagrams:
- Structural ("What" it looks like, not how)
	- Class Diagram
	- Component Diagram
	- Composite Structure Diagram
	- Deployment Diagram
	- Object Diargam
	- Package Diagram
- Behavioural ("How" it works, not what it looks like)
	- Activity Diagram
	- Communication Diagram
	- Interaction Overview Diagram
	- State Machine Diagram
	- Timing Diagram
	- Use-Case Diagram

#### SysML:
- Systems Engineering UML Extension
- Contains diagrams like the requirements diagram
