#### Ethics - 1:
- Moral and ethical issues are huge when considering AI
	- Morals - guidelines that dictate right and wrong
	- Ethical principles - apply at the level of a community, organization or professional.
	- Morals and ethics are connected.

- Ethical codes are characterised as either virtue-based, consequentialist or deontological
	- Virtue ethics emphasise the values and character traits of a virtuous agent
	- Consequentialist (Or utilitarian) ethics focus on the outcomes of possible actions that the agent can take, measuring the global utility of each outcome.
	- Deontological (Or kantian) ethical codes are based on a set of rules the agent should follow.

#### Ethics - Examples:
- Everyday Ethics:
	- Honesty (no lying or cheating even if tempting)
	- Respect (Treat others with dignity and consideration)
	- Responsibility (Taking ownership of our actions and their consequences)
	- Fairness (Ensuring that everyone has equal oppurtunities and is treated justly)
	- Caring (Showing compassion and empathy for others)
	- Confidentiality (Respecting the privacy of others and keeping sensitive information private)

- Business Ethics
	- Integrity (honesty and transparency in deals)
	- Loyalty (being committed to the company and it's values)
	- Accountability (Taking responsibility)
	- Data Protection (Ensuring privacy and security of customer data)
	- Fairness (Ensuring employees are treated fairly)

#### AI Ethics:
- AI ethics are motivated by worries if we can trust AI to behave itself.
- Can we trust AI Systems?
	- Lmao nah not rn
- Can they do the right thing, will they do it?
- A system is only trustworthy if we are confident it will reliably do the right thing.
- See movies and books - we fear robots and other AI systems are untrustworthy.
- Could they become autonomous with free will and consciousness? 
- Trust issues lead to ethical concerns. 
- If AI designers use explicit ethical codes those systems are more likely to be trusted
- If AI systems actually embody ethical codes theyre more likely to be trusted

#### AI Ethics Continued: 
- AI ethics addresses 2 distinct but related topics: 
	- AI Ethics for humans
		- Researchers
		- Designers
		- Developers
		- Deployers
		- Users
	- AI ethics for systems
		- Software agents
		- Embodied robots
- Each topic considers ethical codes, one of the 3 code types either for humans or for systems.
- For humans, there's a need for a professional code of ethics.
- Engineering, legal, medical and computing professions all have explicit deontological ethics codes.
- For computing we have:
	- ACM
	- AAAI
	- IEEE

#### AI ETHICS CONTINUED EVEN FUCKING MORE BECAUSE ITS JUST A SPAM OF A GAZILLION BULLETPOINTS
- What ethical issues arise for us as humans as we interact with AI Systems? 
- Should we give them any rights? 
- Distinguish among moral agents, moral patients and other agents.
	- Moral agents can tell right from wrong and be held responsible for their actions
	- Moral patients should be treated with moral principles by a moral agent.

#### Moral Agents / Patients:
- An adult human is a moral agent and a moral patient
- A baby is a moral patient but not a moral agent
- A car is neither.
- Could AI be ever considered a moral agent? Should it be?
	- Is current AI a moral patient?
- Could future AI systems ever be treated as moral patients? 

#### OMG AI ETHICS CONTINUED :o 
- There's a case study on the 4 forms of  lfacial recognition:
	- Facial detection
		- Finds the location of faces in images
	- Facial characterisation
		- Finds features of individual faces such as approx age, emotions etc
	- Facial verification 
		- Determines if a person matches a given template
	- Facial identification
		- Used to identify each person in an image from a database of faces
		- Usually this is the most problematic one

#### Asimov's Laws of Robotics:
3 original laws:
- A robot may not harm a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
- A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
- A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.


 Thank you that is all. Goodnight.
