#### Topics to prepare for Part 1:
- Agents:
	- Types and Properties
	- Think of examples of each type and explain their suitability for some example scenario.
- Search:
	- Types of search and their properties
		- Will solution be found if one exists
		- Will every solution be found
		- what is the worst case complexity
	- Simple & Informed Search:
		- How does it work?
		- Be able to apply it to a search problem.
	- What search strategies can be used when a global view of the search space is not available?
		-  What properties does each kind of search have?
		- Are some search strategies more likely than others to find an optimal solution
- Constraints:
	- Definition of arc consistency
		- Consistent if, for every value X can take, there is at least one value that Y can take that makes the rule between them true.

	- Application of this definition

#### Remember: Goal Based Agents:
- The agent needs a goal to know which situations are desirable
	- Things become difficult when long sequences of actions are required to find the goal.
- Typically investigated in search and planning research
- Major difference: Future is taken into account
- Is more flexible as knowledge is represented explicitly and can be manipulated>
