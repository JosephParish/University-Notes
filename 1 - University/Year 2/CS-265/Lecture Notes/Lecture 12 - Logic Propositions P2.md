#### Role of Semantics:
- In Computer
	- Light2_broken<- power_in_w_3 ^ sw_3_up ^ unlit_light2.
	- sw_3_up.
	- unlit_light2.
	- power_in_p_1.
- In user's mind:
	- light2_broken: light#2 is broken
	- sw_3_up: switch 3 is up
	- power_in_w_3: There is power in wire 3
	- unlit_light2: Light #2 isn't lit
	- power_in_p_1: outlet p_1 has power
- Conclusion: Light2_broken
	- Computer doesnt know the meaning of the symbols
	- The users can interpret symbols using their meaning

#### Simple Language: Propositional Definite Clauses:
- Propositional Definite Clauses are a restricted form of propositions that cant represent the disjunction of atoms.
	- A body is either:
		- An atom
		- The form b1 ^ b2
			- b1 and b2 are bodies
	- A definite clause is either:
		- an atomic fact: (an atom)
		- a rule, form (h <- b)
			- h is an atom
			- b is a body
		- an atomic fact is treated as a rule with an empty body
	- A knowledge base or logic program is a set of definite clauses.
	- A query is a body that is asked of a knowledge base

#### PROOFS:
- A proof is a mechanically derivable demonstration that a formula logically follows from a knowledge base
- Given a proof procedure, KB |- g means that g can be derived from knowledge base KB
- Recall KB |= g means g is true in all models of KB.
- A Proof procedure is sound if KB |- g implies KB |= g.
	- If a sound proof procedure produces a result, the result is correct.
- A Proof procedure is complete if KB|= g implies KB |- g.
	- A complete proof procedure can produce all results.

#### Bottom-up Proof Procedure
- One rule of derivation, a generalised form of modus ponens:
	- if "h <- b1 ^ ... ^ bm" is a clause in the knowledge base, and each bi has been derived - then h can be derived.
	- This is **forward chaining** on this clause.
		- Prolog uses forward chaining
		- An atomic fact is treated as a clause with empty body (m=0).

#### Soundness of bottom-up proof procedure:
- If KB |- g then KB |= g.
	- Suppose there is a g, such that KB |- g and KB |/= g.
	- Then there must be a first atom added to C that isnt true in every model of KB (call it h)
		- Suppose h isnt true in model I of KB,
	- h was added to C so there must be a clause in KB
		- h <- b1 ^ ... ^ Bm
	- where each bi is in C and so true in I.
		- h is false in I (by assumption)
		- so this clause is false in I
		- Therefore I isnt a model of KB
	- Aaaa contradiction, there cannot exist this alleged g.

#### Completeness:
- If KB |= g, then KB |- g.
	- Suppose KB |=g. Then g is true in all models of KB.
	- Thus g is true in the minimal model.
	- Thus g is in the fixed point
	- Thus g is generated by the bottom up algorithm.
	- Thus KB |- g.
