#### Definition:
A non-deterministic finite automaton over an alphabet (sigma) is given by a set of V states, a transition relation δ ⊆ V × Σ × V, a start state s ∈ V and a set of accepting (or final) states F ⊆ V.

#### Definition:
A deterministic finite automaton over an alphabet Σ is given by a set V of states, a transition function δ : V × Σ → V , a start state s ∈ V and a set of accepting (or final) states F ⊆ V .

#### THE RUN OF AN AUTOMATON:

#### EQUIVALENCE:
- Theorem:
	- Deterministic and non-determinstic finite automata recognise the same languages.

#### The Powerset Construction
(Likely comes up in exam)
- Definition:
	- By P(x) we denote the powerset of the set X,
	- i.e. P(X) = {S | S (subset of) X}.
	- Aka: All possible combinations of the elements of set X.
