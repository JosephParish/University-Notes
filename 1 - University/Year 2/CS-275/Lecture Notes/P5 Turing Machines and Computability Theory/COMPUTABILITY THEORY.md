#### What are the most general models of computaion?
- So far, we consider very restricted models of computation
- From now on, we want fully general models of computation
- It turns out there are a lot of "most general" models of computation, the turing complete ones
- These include programming languages too :0 
#### What will we learn about them? 
- These models are equivalent because we can translate between them (aka a compiler)
- These models allow for universal computation. There are particular instances that can take a description of an arbitrary instance and simulate it (aka interpreter)
- There are also some problems we cannot compute :C 

#### Why we give a shit about turing machines: 
- Turing machines are a very simple model of computation, which is as powerful as it gets.
- This makes it easy to reason about Turing machines (as opposed to programs in real life programming languages)
- Turing machines are not meant for implementation
