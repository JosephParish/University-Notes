#### COMPONENTS:
- Canvas Quizzes - 15% total (Between 0.4-1.5%)
	- Can redo these, get 100%
- Coursework worth 20%
- Exam worth 65%

#### NOTES:
- Should be easy, but do require thinking.

#### AIMS:
- Be able to think like a theoretical computer scientist
- Familiarity with concepts taught do come in handy
- being able to do exercises is a side effect and a means to an end of the thought process
#### WHAT IS A DEFINITION:
- The math version of RTFM
- Cant work with math concepts without knowing the definitions

#### BOTTOM UP VS TOP DOWN:
- Most people learn concepts bottom up (generalising from examples)
- In math, concepts are introduced via definitions
- Examples can reinforce definitions but the definition is first.

#### EXAMPLE:
DEFINITION: A pflumpf is a red house built by a danish architect.
An item is only a pflumpf if:
- Red
- House
- Built by danish architect
All above must be true
- If you're stuck on something, have a look at the definitions of the concepts involved

#### EXERCISES IN THE COURSE:
- Most exercises can be solved through the definitions of the concepts involved and logical reasoning
- We will see a couple "recipes" for complex problems
- You aren't meant to recall lots of factoids

#### Just because in theory there are weaker / stronger definitions, doesnt mean there exists an entity satisfying a weaker definition that does not satisfy the stronger.
There may not exist an item in set X that doesnt exist in set Y (Y is a subset of X)

#### Different Definitions:
- Sometimes people use different definitions
- its likely these are equivalent but not always
- If in doubt, check the local definition
	- Definitions offered in the course > Definitions online or elsewhere
- For example, 0 is a natural number.
