#### A hierarchy - Overview:
From simplest to most complicated:
- Regular languages (having right linear grammars)
- Context-free languages (having context-free grammars)
- Context-sensitive languages (having context-sensitive grammars)
- Computably enumerable languaes (having (unrestricted) grammars)
- Arbitrary languages (not necessarily describable by a grammar at all)
- 
#### Context-free grammars: 
- A grammar is context-free if the left hand side of every rule is a single non-terminal
- Potential Conventions:
	- "Every non terminal appearing on the right of a rule also appears on the left of a different rule"
	- "The right hand of a rule has at most 2 symbols"

#### A context-free language which is not regular
- Proposition:
	- The language {a^n b^n | n (element of) N} is context free, but not regular.
- Proof:
	- We show it is not regular using the pumping lemma
	- It is context free as it's generated by the grammar:
		- S -> e
		- S -> aSb

#### Parse Trees: 
- A parse tree for a context-free grammar is a tree labelled by terminals, non-terminals and e - subject to the following rules:
	- The root is labelled S.
	- A vertex is a leaf if and only if it is labelled by a terminal or e.
	- For every non-leaf v, there is a rule with the label of v on the left, and the concatenation of the child labels on the right.
	- e appears only as only child
- Theorem:
	- The language generated by a context-free grammar consists exactly of words built from the terminals on the leaves of finite parse trees, in order.

#### Example: 
- Consider the following grammar:
	- S -> 0
	- S -> 1
	- S -> 2
	- S -> (S + S)
	- S -> (S x S)
- And the word: 
	- ((0 + 1) x (2 x (1 + 0)))
- we would have a parse tree of:

- To show that a word belongs to the language of a context free grammar, try to construct a parse tree bottom-up.


#### Constructing a Parse Tree: 
- Consider the context-free grammar:
	- S -> ST
	- S -> ε
	- T -> a
	- T -> Ub
	- U -> Ub
	- U -> ε
- Solution:

#### Closure Properties: 
- Theorem:
- Context free languages are closed under:
	- Union
	- Concatenation
	- Kleene-star
	- Intersection with regular languages
	- Reversal
- Context fre languages are NOT closed under:
	- Intersection
	- Complement
