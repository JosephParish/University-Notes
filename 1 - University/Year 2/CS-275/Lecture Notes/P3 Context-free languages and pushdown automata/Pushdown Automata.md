#### Typical examples of context-free non-regular languages: 
- {a^n b^n | n (element of) N} is context free but not regular
- {w | w = w^R} is context-free, but not regular
A problem:
- Finite automata cannot remember anything except via states

#### A Stack
- Reminder:
	- A stack can be implemented by a list of which we can only:
		- Look at the first element of the list (inc testing if there is none) (peek)
		- Removing the first element of the list (pop)
		- Append a new element to the front of the list (push)

#### Pushdown Automata - An informal definition:
- Basic Idea: 
	- A pushdown automaton is a finite automaton which also has a single stack (woah he got that shit on him tho)
	- When we're choosing an outgoing transition, we can take both the input symbol and the top of the stack into account.
	- Transition can happen without advancing the input
	- Upon completing a transition, we can either push a symbol onto the stack or pop it.

#### Pushdown Automata - A formal (and kinda cringe) definition:
- A pushdown automata over the alphabet Σ is given by a tuple 
	- (Q, Γ, δ, F) whereL
		- Q is the set of states, with a special start state q0
		- F (subset of Q) is the set of final states
		- Γ is the stack alphabet, with a special symbol ⊥ /∈ Γ which means the stack is empty
		- δ, a subset of Q × (Σ ∪ {ε}) × (Γ ∪ ⊥) × Q × (Γ ∪ ⊥) is the transition relation
			- what? 

#### Configurations - Definition:
- A configuration of a pushdown automaton is an element of Q x Γ*
- The initial configuration is (q0, e) [starting state, empty set]

#### Accepting Inputs: 
- Definition
	- A word is accepted by a pushdown automaton if we reach an accepting configuration upon reading it.
- Theorem:
	- A language is recognised by a pushdown automaton if (and only if) it is generated by a context-free grammar

#### OMG LOOK ITS A PUSHDOWN AUTOMATON!

- How the flip does the notation work on this?
	- Current input symbol, top of stack : pop or (symbol to push)

#### Pushdown Automata - Fun facts! 
- The requirement that the stack must be emptied is not used by everyone, however it IS used in this module!
	- SO MAKE SURE UR STACK IS EMPTY AT THE END OR ITS NOT ACCEPTED
- We can push multiple symbols onto the stack at the same time
- If we would use a queue instead of a stack, we get something more powerful.
- If we use 2 stacks we can recognize all computably enumerable languages (its a turing machine copslay at this point)
- We can't require our pushdown automata to be deterministic


#### From Context-Free Grammar to Pushdown Automaton:
- Question: Construct a pushdown automaton for the language described by the grammar:
	- S -> aSbS
	- S -> bSaS
	- S -> ε
