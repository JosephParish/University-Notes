#### Typical examples of context-free, non regular languages: 
- {a^n b^n | n ∈ N} is context free, but not regular
- Problem:
	- Finite automata cannot remember anything except via states

#### A stack:
- Reminder:
	- A stack can be implemented by a list, where we can only: 
		- Look at the first element of the list
			- includes testing if there is one
		- Remove the first element of the list
		- Append a new element to the front of the list

#### Pushdown automata - Informal
- Basic idea:
	- A pushdown automaton is a finite automaton equipped with one single stack
	- When choosing an outgoing transition, we take both the input symbol AND the top of the stack into account
	- Transition can happen without advancing the input
	- Upon completing a transaction, we can either push a sybol onto the stack or pop it.

#### Configurations: 
A configuration of a pushdown automaton describes its current state and stack of contents. It takes the form of (currentState, stackOfContents)
- A configuration of a pushdown automaton if an element of Q x Γ∗.
- The initial configuration is (q0, ε)
- At the start, the PDA is in its **initial state** with an **empty stack**.
- If the stack has **something on top**, the PDA can **read an input**, **change state**, and **update the stack**.
- If the stack is **empty**, it follows special rules using a **bottom marker (⊥)** to keep 
- If the stack's top matches a rule saying "pop," the PDA **removes** it and moves to the next state.
- If a rule allows **adding** something to the stack **without reading input**, the PDA updates the stack and stays in place.
- If the stack is **empty** and a rule allows adding something, the PDA just updates the stack.
- If a rule allows **removing** the stack’s top **without reading input**, the PDA just pops it and moves on.
- The PDA **accepts** if it reaches a final state **with an empty stack**.

#### Accepting Inputs:
- Definition:
	- A word is accepted by a pushdown automaton if we can reach an accepting configuration upon reaching it.
- Theorem:
	- A language is recognised by a pushdown automaton iff it is generated by a context free grammar.

#### Pushdown Automata Facts
- The requirement the stack needs to be emptied is not used by everyone, however is used in this module.
- We could push multiple symbols on the stack at the same time.
- If we would use a queue instead of a stack, we get something more powerful. 
- If we had two stacks, we would recognise all computably enumerable languages.
	- Because it can simulate a turing machine
- We dont have an analogue to the powerset construction
	- AKA we cant require our pushdown automaton to be deterministic
