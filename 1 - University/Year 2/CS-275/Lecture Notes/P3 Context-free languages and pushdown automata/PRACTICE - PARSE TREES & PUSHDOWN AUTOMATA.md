#### PARSE TREES:
Definition:
- A parse tree for a context-free grammar is a tree labelled by:
	- terminals
	- non-terminals
	- e
- It is also subject to the following rules:
	- The root is labelled S
	- A vertext is a leaf iff it is labeled by a terminal or e
	- For every non-leaf v, there is:
		- a rule with a label of v on the left 
		- the concatenation of the child labels on the right
		- e appeats only as only child
- Theorem:
	- The language generated by a context-free grammar consists exactly of the words built from the terminals on the leaves of finite parse trees, in order.

E.G:
- Consider the following grammar:
	- S -> 0
	- S -> 1
	- S -> 2
	- S -> (S + S)
	- S -> (S x S)
- And the word:
	- ((0+1) x (2 x (1 + 0)))
- The parse tree would look like such:

#### FROM CONTEXT-FREE GRAMMAR TO A PUSHDOWN AUTOMATON
- Construct a pushdown automaton described by the following grammar:
	- S -> aSbS
	- S ->bSaS
	- S -> e
