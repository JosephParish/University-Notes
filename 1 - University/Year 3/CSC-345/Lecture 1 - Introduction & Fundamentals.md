#### Big Data: Definition
- Big data is not a scientific term
- Refers to extremely large data sets
	- So large traditional data processing applications are inadequate


#### Big Data Value Chain:
- Acquisition
- Analysis
- Curation
- Storage
- Usage

#### Structured VS Unstructured Data: 
- Structured Data:
	- Can be displayed in rows and columns
	- Contains numbers, dates and strings
	- Approximately 20% of  enterprise data
	- Requires less storage
	- Easier to manage and protect with legacy solutions
- Unstructured Data: 
	- Cannot be displayed in rows, columns and relational databases
	- Images, audio, video, word processing files, emails, spreadsheets etc
	- Approximately 80% of enterprise data
	- Requires more storage
	- More difficult to manage and protect with legacy systems

#### The 6 'V's of big data: 
-  Volume
	- The amount of data from all sources
- Variety
	- The types of data: Structured, Unstructured, Semi-Structured
- Velocity
	- The speed in which big data is generated
- Veracity
	- The degree in which big data can be trusted
- Value
	- The business value of the data collected
- Variability
	- The ways in which the big data can be used and formatted

#### AI, ML and DL
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI 
Deep learning (DL)  is a subset of ML 


#### CPU vs GPU or AI
- CPU
	- Low compute density
	- Complex control logic
	- Large caches
	- Optimised for serial operations
	- Low-latency tolerance (fewer delays preferred)
	- Newer CPUs have more parallelism however
- GPU
	- High compute density
	- High computations per memory access
	- Built for parallel operations
	- Deep pipelines
	- High throughput
	- High latency tolerance
	- More cores for specific calculations


#### Human Intelligence (HI) vs Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Human Intelligence
	- Human Neural Network + Human Muscle-Skeleton System
- Artificial Intelligence
	- Artificial Neural Network + Robot Actuation-Mechanical System

#### Machine Learning Definitions:
- Algorithms that PTE:
	- P -> Improve performance
	- T -> at some task
	- E -> with Experience

#### What is Machine Learning? 
![[Pasted image 20250930141857.png]]
(note the output from computer 1 in ML is input to computer 2)
Machine learning can be considered as a function such as:
f (\<image of cat>) = "Cat"
f(\<go board>) = "5-5" (best move) 
etc....

#### 3 Basic Steps of ML:
1. Define a set of functions
2. Score the functions on a level of "goodness"
3. Pick the best function

(f1 here is clearly better), we pick the best function and assign it f*
