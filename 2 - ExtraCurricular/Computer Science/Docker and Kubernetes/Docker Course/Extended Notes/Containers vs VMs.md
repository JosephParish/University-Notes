# **Containers vs VMs**

- Containers share the host OS kernel, while VMs run full guest OSes.
- Containers are lightweight, start quickly, and use fewer resources compared to VMs.
- VMs provide stronger isolation but with more overhead.
- Containers package applications and dependencies; VMs virtualize hardware.
- Use cases: containers for microservices and rapid deployment; VMs for complete OS environments and legacy apps.
- Containers can run inside VMs for hybrid approaches.
