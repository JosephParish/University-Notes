# **Docker Compose cheatsheet**

- Docker Compose uses a YAML file to define multi-container applications. 
- Common sections: `services`, `volumes`, `networks`. 
- Key commands: `docker-compose up` (start services), `docker-compose down` (stop and remove), `docker-compose logs` (view logs), `docker-compose exec` (run commands inside containers). 
- Supports build from local Dockerfile or pulling images. 
- Volumes can be defined and mounted for data persistence. 
- Useful for local development, testing, and simple deployments.
